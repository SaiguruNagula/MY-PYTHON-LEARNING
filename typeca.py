#Explicit typecasting:
#The conversion of one data type into another data type, done via developer or programmer's intervention or manually as per the requirement,
#  is known as explicit type conversion.
#It can be achieved with the help of Pythonâ€™s built-in type conversion functions such as int(), float(), hex(), oct(), str(), etc .
string = "15"
number = 7
string_number = int(string) #throws an error if the string is not a valid integer 
sum= number + string_number
print("The Sum of both the numbers is: ", sum)
